# Stroop-Color-and-Word-Task
This script implements a classic Stroop Task using PsychoPy. Participants view color words (RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW) displayed in either congruent or incongruent ink colors and must respond to the ink color, not the word meaning. Reaction times, accuracy, and participant information are collected and saved automatically.
